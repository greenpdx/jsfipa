Javascript library supporting FIPA transport protocol.

As the "Internet of Things" grows, search and adapt will become more important.  <a href="http://www.fipa.org">FIPA</a> is a IEEE Computer Society standards organization.  It protocol is the base for many Agent and Multi-Agent systems. 

The IoT will not grow as expected.  There is just a too diverse enviroment out there. That phrase will come to have a different meaning to lay people as they will only see the UI. They do not see the message passing that drives the network.  Right now IoT is Intel's low level secure message system.  As agents based systems grow in number and complexity, IoT will mean doing anything around the house or the world that you have access privilage to. 

If a multi-agent system like FIPA can be brought to the browser space, The positive side is searchs are distributed and the User Interface to IoT(using the lay person term) is adaptable.  Today, browsers and mobile devices are the User Interface. Also today searchs are controled by few search companies. Tomorrow searchs can be like bit torrent, but your using Meta-Data not the data it self.  Now searchs can be optimized better, people can find the exact thing they want.  Now there is some algorthyem 

. The negitive side is paywall and filtering are made easier.  You are not blocking filtering data, your are filtering "MetaData", that has a more regular structure and smaller volume.

This is just a proof-of-concept project.  I have ADHD so I can not stay with a project.
